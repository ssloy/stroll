This project is a stub for a small programming project, it shows how to start with SDL and Makefile.
The code contains a **very** crude and basic raytracer and is not meant to be used as is.

The textures are courtesy of Andr√© LaMothe and were initially distrubuted on
floppy discs with his excellent book "Tricks of the Game-Programming Gurus" published in 1994.
